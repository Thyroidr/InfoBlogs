Due to losing the original blog sources, I will create the wheel again and have the blog re-established using hexo. This is planed to occur during Jan, 2021. 

## Planned features
- markdown support
- timestamped articles
- categories and labels
- in general everything hexo supports
- most of the articles from the original blog, some articles of poor quality will not be re-uploaded

## Potential features
- comments (used to exist, not really used)
- actually organised articles by category (dunno how to do this under the hexo framework)
